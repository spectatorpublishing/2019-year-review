readers,   \n\nThe school year has nearly come and gone, and with its close we archive another full year of reporting and writing. This past year, I\u2019ve been particularly proud of the ways our stories have pushed us to view our campus and the community we inhabit in a new light.   \n\nWe set our sights forward and wrote about the way things grow and change: from Barnard\u2019s neuroscience program, to the birth of strange, new academic fields, to the very meaning of the \u2018Women\u2019s College\u2019. We shadowed mathletes prepping for a national competition, student musicians readying to take the stage, and psychiatric researchers developing mental health education in Harlem. We worried a lot about our future: What happens to local nonprofits when University funding runs out? How can Barnard help cultivate community for its FGLI students? Can Columbia\u2019s fraternities change?   \n\nWe dove backwards, deep into the archives, gleaning knowledge from our tumultuous past. We excavated a history of struggles at Columbia\u2014for hiring and funding and unions and parties and spaces (and more spaces) and even for the preservation of history itself. We remembered how things came to be: a neighborhood, a jazz club, your dorm, and we remembered things no longer with us: beloved professors and priests, a University-run shelter, and an entire college Columbia may prefer to forget.   \n\nWe turned our gaze outwards, beyond the borders of the Morningside campus and into the West Harlem community. We wrote and wrote and wrote about the Community Benefits Agreement, the document that enshrines Columbia\u2019s commitments to the neighborhood in compensation for its Manhattanville expansion. We thought about the consequences of that expansion\u2014about how local residents remain resilient in the face of displacement and noise, and about how the expansion has shaped local hiring, on construction sites and among residents.   \n\nWe looked inwards, in our essays, reflecting on our walks and our runs (political and otherwise), on how others try to define us, and on how we define ourselves. We wrote about about loss of family and of home, about identity as a daughter and a sister and a brother. We chased waterfalls and connecting flights. We thought about what it meant to be both here and not, to enter the public record, to become engulfed in a media firestorm. We took more walks\u2014some of these were long and painful walks and others had dogs\u2014and we thought a lot on those walks, about music, about lights. We've also had our walks interrupted by the odd headless eel.  \n\nBut wherever we looked, we looked closely: peeking behind the closed door of the Advisory Committee on Socially Responsible Investing, unearthing Columbia\u2019s underground music scene, and stepping into the exclusive world of student clubs. We parsed through many, many pages of policy, investigating how Columbia\u2019s gender-based misconduct policy has left student leaders facing accusations within their groups without clear guidance, and how hate crime and bias-incident response protocols have been applied inconsistently, if at all. We analyzed 327 pages of legalese, which we carried in our backpacks for weeks, in order to understand how the Declaration of Covenants and Restrictions informs Columbia\u2019s relationship with the West Harlem community. We scrutinized governmental policies, too, and found that for international graduate students and postdocs, life can hinge on the limitations of visa policy.   \n\nAs we set our sights on summer after a year of looking elsewhere, we leave knowing a little better what our university and our community look like. Whether the next four months bring you a life-changing trek in the Himalayas, or a life-affirming experience in the field you\u2019ve dreamed of, or, possibly, just an internship at Goldman Sachs, we can only hope that we\u2019ve made an impact on the way you see campus\u2014that everything we have researched, reported, and written has challenged you to look at Columbia through the same eyes that we do: lovingly and critically and carefully.  \n\nSee you next year,  \n\nJulian Shen-Berro  \nManaging Editor of The

As Provost John Coatsworth is set to step down at the end of June, questions regarding resources for faculty, pipeline programs for diversity, and faculty benefits will be transferred to a new administrator for the first time in nearly a decade.",articles:[{title:"Your professors pay more for childcare than you do for tuition. 4 of them explain what this means for their lives, and your education.",author:"Noah Percy",link:"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2019/04/25/your-professor-pays-more-for-childcare-than-you-do-for-tuition-4-faculty-explain-what-this-means-for-their-lives-and-your-education/",img:"https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-spectator.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5HKPWFTXBZGLXEDMSEZKHE3E2Y.jpg"},{title:"Senate passes resolution to create and document bylaws, including guidelines for faculty grievances",author:"Emma James",link:"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2019/04/08/senate-passes-resolution-to-create-and-document-bylaws-including-guidelines-for-faculty-grievances/",img:"https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-spectator.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VU4IBS6FUZBSRCX47NNCDYQ45E.jpg"},{title:"How 4 faculty helped create Columbia\u2019s first African American and African Diaspora studies department",author:"Shubham Saharan and Madison Andrus",link:"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2019/02/25/how-4-faculty-helped-create-columbias-first-african-american-and-african-diaspora-studies-department-2/",img:"https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-spectator.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XQJ4XNEE4VCBJHD3MSW6KYBLSE.jpg"},{title:"Columbia has $185 million in dedicated funds.

Despite the setbacks, however, the 2015 hire of head coach Al Bagnoli appears to be paying off, as the team\u2019s 6-4 finish marked the first time in 56 years that it had a winning record two seasons in a row.","The injuries began piling up during the first game of the season against Central Connecticut State. Star junior wideout Josh Wainwright, who was elected captain for the upcoming season, suffered a torn ACL, which sidelined him for the duration of the season. After a 2017 season in which he broke Columbia\u2019s record for most receiving yards in an individual season, hauling in 1,001 yards, Wainwright gained only 46 yards this season.","Aside from Wainwright\u2019s devastating injury, the team\u2019s greatest pitfall this year was the lack of an established quarterback or consistent play from any of the four players who took snaps under center. With the graduation of Anders Hill, CC \u201918, who threw for over 2,400 yards and led multiple late-game comebacks in 2017, the team struggled to maintain its dominance following his departure.","Early on in the season, the team turned to sophomore Josh Bean, who spent the majority of his playing time in the 2017-2018 season in a run-oriented wildcat-style position. In the first game of the season, Bean took multiple serious hits to the head, leading him to be sidelined with a concussion. To take over the starting role, the team initially looked to first-year Ty Lenhart, but pulled him out after he failed to lead the team downfield in his first two possessions. The coaching staff then turned to first-year Dillon Davis, which proved equally unsuccessful.","After early season questions, the team decided to stick with Lenhart as long as Bean was out\u2014which later became a necessity, as Bean only made appearances in four games. Depending on who was playing quarterback, offensive coordinator Mark Fabish called the game very differently, as Bean finished with an average 28.5 pass attempts in the games in which he appeared, as opposed to Lenhart\u2019s 13.9.","Ultimately, the team finished fourth among the Ancient Eight, going 3-4 in Ivy League play. Despite the tumultuous 2018 season, expectations are high for next year\u2014as 16 starters will return to the team, seven on offense and nine on defense, with a number of key contributors returning from injury. One thing to watch out for in particular is how well the new quarterbacks coach, Ryan Larsen, and the new wide receivers coach, Jerry Taylor, mesh in Bagnoli\u2019s system.","Next season will be Bagnoli\u2019s fifth year leading the program, meaning that the entire roster is now comprised of players he recruited. The 2019 season will serve as an opportunity to see whether his vision for the program will translate into success; and as long as the quarterback position is settled, and the team is not plagued by injuries again, there is a good chance that the Lions will be able to rise to the level of success they achieved in 2017."]},{name:"Men\u2019s Basketball",img:"https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-spectator.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G2BHNCJ7SNF6TAZB527KQD2ZTM.jpg",blurb:["Despite entering the season with an uncertain rotation following the departure of four key contributors following the 2017-2018 season, the men\u2019s basketball team slightly improved their record, finishing 10-18, up from 8-19 last year. However, the team fared no better this season in Ivy play than in regular season play, rounding out the year with a 5-9 record in each.","The departures, particularly those of forwards Jaron Faulds and Lukas Meisner, left the team with only one traditional big man on the roster, 6-foot-10-inch junior forward Patrick Tap\xe9. While third-year head coach Jim Engles chose to go with a smaller lineup at the beginning of the season, starting 6-foot-7-inch, 200-pound sophomore Randy Brumant and 6-foot-7-inch, 240-pound first-year Ike Nweke, Tap\xe9 was given more time as the season progressed. It became clear early on that the lack of an interior presence allowed Columbia\u2019s opponents to score inside seemingly at will. Engles\u2019 adjustment paid off, as Tap\xe9 was selected as an honorable mention for the All-Ivy team.","Despite their in-season adjustments, the Lions were unable to make up for their lack of height. With an average height of 75.5 inches, which ranks 329 out of 353 Division I teams, the team tried to counter taller teams by modernizing their style and committing to three-point shooting. While the Light Blue finished the season ranked 95th in three-point field goals per game, they were unable to make up for the void in talent created in particular by Faulds, who is the highest-ranked high school recruit to ever commit to Columbia.","The team also struggled in close games, finishing 5-9 in games decided by three or fewer points. No game stands out more than the teams February 8 matchup with Harvard, who finished tied for the best record in league play. In a game that featured two overtime periods, sophomore guard Gabe Stefanini led the way in scoring, dropping 26 points while shooting 10-25 from the field. In addition, senior guard Quinton Adlesh, who will play next season as a graduate transfer for University of Southern California, played a Columbia record 52 minutes in the game, contributing 24 points of his own.","While this season proved to be another disappointing one, there is hope that the team can improve next year, as Stefanini, an All-Ivy second teamer, and Tap\xe9 have another offseason to continue to develop."]},{name:"Women\u2019s Basketball:",img:"https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-spectator.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XBXCMSOJFNCCLEYO3NADARIVTA.jpg",blurb:["In the three years under head coach Megan Griffith, CC \u201907, the Lions have struggled to find their rhythm, finishing with just eight wins for a second consecutive season.

This was particularly true in matchups within the Ivy League, in which the Light Blue went 4-10.","After starting the season off by winning their first two games, the Lions went on to lose nine in a row over nearly a two-month stretch before defeating Hampton University in January. ","However, the prominence of the team\u2019s underclassmen offers reason for optimism that the team\u2019s fortunes could change over the next few years.

The victory marked the teams\u2019 16th national title in the program\u2019s history.","The Lions started out the season strong, winning five straight matches before suffering their first loss of the season to in-conference rival Yale. After that match, the team\u2019s only loss for the rest of the season came against Penn State, a loss they would later avenge in the championship bout. After sweeping five of their six meets, Columbia secured outright Ivy League titles for both men and women for the first time since 2008.","The championship squad featured a talent-filled roster, including ten All-Americans and two individual national champions in sophomore Sylvie Binder and junior Anne Cebula.

The pair competed in the tournament along with junior Jackie Tang, who was ranked as high as No. 28. However, they were unable to take home the title for the Light Blue. ","The fall season culminated with Lin winning the New York Open College Wild Card Invitational. In February, Lin took part in the feature match on College Night, but was unable to defeat his opponent in order to make it into the main draw.","The dual season began with Lin once again proving his ability to defeat any opponent as he took the singles title at the MLK Invitational in Atlanta. Lin defeated Jan Zielinski, ranked No. 2 at the time, and went on to beat two more ranked opponents before taking home the crown. This tournament also marked the return to the court of senior co-captain Victor Pham, who battled a wrist injury over the fall season, and junior Alex Keyser, who had suffered from a knee injury. Both Pham and Keyser brought home wins in singles and doubles back to Morningside Heights.","On the team\u2019s annual spring break trip to Texas, Goswami reached a milestone that few coaches can tout: his 500th win. The Lions went on to triumph in 10 matches before setting their sights on the Ancient Eight crown. ","Despite their great success, the Lions suffered through another season riddled with injuries. Tang had to sit out the entire spring season while Lin had to take a match off. Goswami feared that, with so many injuries, the team would struggle during Ivy play. But the players proved Goswami wrong, earning a perfect 7-0 record against Ivy competitors. ","After blanking Yale, Penn, and Dartmouth, the Lions continued their Ivy dominance. Pham swept his league opponents with a flawless 7-0 record. ","The season culminated in a heated face-off against Cornell, a match that would determine whether Columbia would share the title or claim its sole ownership. After a high intensity match, in which five out of six Lions lost their first set in singles play, it was junior Adam Ambrozy, ranked as high as No. 32 this season, who clinched the match\u2014and the title\u2014in a third set tie-breaker against Lev Kazakov.

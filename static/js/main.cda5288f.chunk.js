This year, like each that has come before it, gave rise to moments of victory and defeat, separation and unity, stasis and progress. \n\nFollowing several hate crimes and incidents of racist harassment on campus, an investigation in The Eye found that university response protocols had been applied inconsistently, if at all. Students mobilized in support of their peers, giving new energy to enduring conversations about racial discrimination at Columbia and Barnard, including on the role of Public Safety. \n\nBoth nationally and locally, conversations about the role of institutions in handling allegations of sexual misconduct sparked heated discourse. At the beginning of the fall semester, students flocked to Low Steps in protest of Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court. After numerous tenured professors were accused or found guilty of sexual misconduct, Spectator conducted a yearlong investigation into the tension between faculty tenure and Title IX protections, which revealed that Columbia has never in its history stripped tenure rights from a faculty member accused or found guilty of sexual misconduct.\n\nConsequential administrative decisions and changes further swept the University. In November, after years of refusing to recognize the graduate student union, the University met the union at the bargaining table and consented to enter contract negotiations. Provost John Coatsworth announced that he will leave the University in June, while Barnard students saw the appointment of Dean of the College Leslie Grinage as well as inaugural VP of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Ariana Gonz\xe1lez Stokas. And in February, a beloved member of the Columbia community, former General Studies Dean Peter Awn, passed away. \n\nAs the semester comes to a close, we invite you to take a look back on the stories that shaped a pivotal year in Columbia\u2019s history.

In many ways, Columbia deals with its own unique sense of transience\u2014students coming and going as four years quickly pass by. There is a paradox that exists on this campus that becomes clear when the flowers start blooming and everyone floods to Low Steps after the slightest glimpse of sun.\n\nOur campus begins to come alive at the same moment that we\u2019re meant to leave it.\n\nBecause of this, it\u2019s hard not to reminisce on all that\u2019s happened throughout the whirlwind of the past nine months\u2014what\u2019s been done, seen, and said by those around you. Over the past year you\u2019ve talked about your love lives, your careers, and, of course, your Juul addictions. \n\nWithin the opinion section, students, faculty, professors, and administrators have responded to and written about how Columbia deals with sexual assault, the virulent acts of racism our campus has grappled with, the college admissions scandal, and so much more. Our job is not to report what\u2019s going on, but to give members of this community a chance and a platform to reflect on it. We hope that the following pages, in many ways, help do just that. \n\nSo now, it\u2019s time to say goodbye to all that\u2014for summer at least.

Despite the setbacks, however, the 2015 hire of head coach Al Bagnoli appears to be paying off, as the team\u2019s 6-4 finish marked the first time in 56 years that it had a winning record two seasons in a row.","The injuries began piling up during the first game of the season against Central Connecticut State. Star junior wideout Josh Wainwright, who was elected captain for the upcoming season, suffered a torn ACL, which sidelined him for the duration of the season. After a 2017 season in which he broke Columbia\u2019s record for most receiving yards in an individual season, hauling in 1,001 yards, Wainwright gained only 46 yards this season.","Aside from Wainwright\u2019s devastating injury, the team\u2019s greatest pitfall this year was the lack of an established quarterback or consistent play from any of the four players who took snaps under center. With the graduation of Anders Hill, CC \u201918, who threw for over 2,400 yards and led multiple late-game comebacks in 2017, the team struggled to maintain its dominance following his departure.","Early on in the season, the team turned to sophomore Josh Bean, who spent the majority of his playing time in the 2017-2018 season in a run-oriented wildcat-style position. In the first game of the season, Bean took multiple serious hits to the head, leading him to be sidelined with a concussion. To take over the starting role, the team initially looked to first-year Ty Lenhart, but pulled him out after he failed to lead the team downfield in his first two possessions. The coaching staff then turned to sophomore Dillon Davis, which proved equally unsuccessful.","After early season questions, the team decided to stick with Lenhart as long as Bean was out\u2014which later became a necessity, as Bean only made appearances in four games. Depending on who was playing quarterback, offensive coordinator Mark Fabish called the game very differently, as Bean finished with an average 28.5 pass attempts in the games in which he appeared, as opposed to Lenhart\u2019s 13.9.","Ultimately, the team finished fourth among the Ancient Eight, going 3-4 in Ivy League play. Despite the tumultuous 2018 season, expectations are high for next year\u2014as 16 starters will return to the team, seven on offense and nine on defense, with a number of key contributors returning from injury. One thing to watch out for in particular is how well the new quarterbacks coach, Ryan Larsen, and the new wide receivers coach, Jerry Taylor, mesh in Bagnoli\u2019s system.","Next season will be Bagnoli\u2019s fifth year leading the program, meaning that the entire roster is now comprised of players he recruited. The 2019 season will serve as an opportunity to see whether his vision for the program will translate into success; and as long as the quarterback position is settled, and the team is not plagued by injuries again, there is a good chance that the Lions will be able to rise to the level of success they achieved in 2017."]},{name:"Men\u2019s Basketball",author:"Harris Walker",img:"https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-spectator.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G2BHNCJ7SNF6TAZB527KQD2ZTM.jpg",blurb:["Despite entering the season with an uncertain rotation following the departure of four key contributors following the 2017-2018 season, the men\u2019s basketball team slightly improved their record, finishing 10-18, up from 8-19 last year. However, the team fared no better this season in Ivy play than in regular season play, rounding out the year with a 5-9 record in each.","The departures, particularly those of forwards Jaron Faulds and Lukas Meisner, left the team with only one traditional big man on the roster, 6-foot-10-inch junior forward Patrick Tap\xe9. While third-year head coach Jim Engles chose to go with a smaller lineup at the beginning of the season, starting 6-foot-7-inch, 200-pound sophomore Randy Brumant and 6-foot-7-inch, 240-pound first-year Ike Nweke, Tap\xe9 was given more time as the season progressed. It became clear early on that the lack of an interior presence allowed Columbia\u2019s opponents to score inside seemingly at will. Engles\u2019 adjustment paid off, as Tap\xe9 was selected as an honorable mention for the All-Ivy team.","Despite their in-season adjustments, the Lions were unable to make up for their lack of height. With an average height of 75.5 inches, which ranks 329 out of 353 Division I teams, the team tried to counter taller teams by modernizing their style and committing to three-point shooting. While the Light Blue finished the season ranked 95th in three-point field goals per game, they were unable to make up for the void in talent created in particular by Faulds, who is the highest-ranked high school recruit to ever commit to Columbia.","The team also struggled in close games, finishing 5-9 in games decided by three or fewer points. No game stands out more than the teams February 8 matchup with Harvard, who finished tied for the best record in league play. In a game that featured three overtime periods, sophomore guard Gabe Stefanini led the way in scoring, dropping 26 points while shooting 10-25 from the field. In addition, senior guard Quinton Adlesh, who will play next season as a graduate transfer for University of Southern California, played a Columbia record 52 minutes in the game, contributing 24 points of his own.","While this season proved to be another disappointing one, there is hope that the team can improve next year, as Stefanini, an All-Ivy second teamer, and Tap\xe9 have another offseason to continue to develop."]},{name:"Women\u2019s Basketball",author:"Harris Walker",img:"https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-spectator.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XBXCMSOJFNCCLEYO3NADARIVTA.jpg",blurb:["In the three years under head coach Megan Griffith, CC \u201907, the Lions have struggled to find their rhythm, finishing with just eight wins for a second consecutive season.

This was particularly true in matchups within the Ivy League, in which the Light Blue went 4-10.","After starting the season off by winning their first two games, the Lions went on to lose nine in a row over nearly a two-month stretch before defeating Hampton University in January.

In February, Lin took part in the feature match on College Night, but was unable to defeat his opponent in order to make it into the main draw.","The dual season began with Lin once again proving his ability to defeat any opponent as he took the singles title at the MLK Invitational in Atlanta. Lin defeated Jan Zielinski, ranked No. 2 at the time, and went on to beat two more ranked opponents before taking home the crown. This tournament also marked the return to the court of senior co-captain Victor Pham, who battled a wrist injury over the fall season, and junior Alex Keyser, who had suffered from a knee injury. Both Pham and Keyser brought home wins in singles and doubles back to Morningside Heights.","On the team\u2019s annual spring break trip to Texas, Goswami reached a milestone that few coaches can tout: his 500th win. The Lions went on to triumph in 10 matches before setting their sights on the Ancient Eight crown. ","Despite their great success, the Lions suffered through another season riddled with injuries. Tang had to sit out the entire spring season while Lin had to take a match off. Goswami feared that, with so many injuries, the team would struggle during Ivy play. But the players proved Goswami wrong, earning a perfect 7-0 record against Ivy competitors. ","After blanking Yale, Penn, and Dartmouth, the Lions continued their Ivy dominance. Pham swept his league opponents with a flawless 7-0 record. ","The season culminated in a heated face-off against Cornell, a match that would determine whether Columbia would share the title or claim its sole ownership. After a high intensity match, in which five out of six Lions lost their first set in singles play, it was junior Adam Ambrozy, ranked as high as No. 32 this season, who clinched the match\u2014and the title\u2014in a third set tie-breaker against Lev Kazakov.
